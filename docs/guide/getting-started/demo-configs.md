# Demo configs

We provide a `demo-configs` folder with demo files of the configurations we use in our demos.

You can use these files to get the configurations like our demos.

All you have to do is replace desired demo config file with `/themeConfig.ts` file.

::: warning
Some of the configurations are **stored in localStorage** hence, you'll have to **clear the application data** in your browser like shown in the below image and refresh the page.
