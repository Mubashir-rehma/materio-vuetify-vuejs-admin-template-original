# Picker

## Header color in Dark

You might be facing below issue where header is not looking as expected:

<img :src="$withBase('/images/components/picker-wo-color-prop-in-dark.png')" alt="picker-wo-color-prop-in-dark" class="medium-zoom">

To resolve above issue you have to add color prop to picker even if you want `primary` picker.

<img :src="$withBase('/images/components/picker-w-color-prop-in-dark.png')" alt="picker-w-color-prop-in-dark" class="medium-zoom">
