## Raising GitHub Issue

Raising GitHub issue in GitHub is as simple as commenting on post. However, If you want get your issues resolved quickly please follow below guide:

### Finding existing solution

There might be case that you issue is already resolved and you are the one who is facing due to some issue. So before creating new GitHub issue please search it in our [FAQ page](/faq/) where we listed most common questions/issues asked in GitHub or you can search for the same in GitHub .

### Issue Type

Add issue type to your issue title to let community understand what your issue is about. This also help in finding related issues using issue type.

So, your issue shall be like `[question] how to change theme?`

Some common issue types are listed below:

| Type         | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| question     | If you are asking question                                   |
| installation | If you have anything related to installation                 |
| auth         | If you have anything related to JWT or Auth                  |
| acl          | If you have anything related to Access Control               |
| feat         | If you have any feature request for our template             |
| bug          | If you find any bug in template                              |

- [auth] Unexpected behavior after login
- [other] Collapse component is not working as expected
- [acl] How to disable certain routes for some user
- [auth] I get redirected to login page even after login on refresh

### New Query - New Issue

Following above suggestion, it will be good if you create another GitHub issue if you have any other question/issue which is not related to your current issue.

Let's say you opened issue for installation issue and want to ask about some component usage then it will be better to close installation issue and open another issue for that component to make GitHub issues more accurate and easy to find place.

### Template Version

Mentioning template version include if you are using Vue full version or Vue Starter-kit. Also, if you are using some other technology with our template then mention it will also help us in resolving issue quickly. [e.g. Vuexy Vue + Firebase]

### Sharing Code or Snippet

If you want to show us some code it will be better if you can format it properly and use code block so your pasted code get highlighted.

### Reproducing Issue/Bug - Starter-kit

If you have ticket where we need to have a look at your code like some component's certain feature is working in our live demo but not in your downloaded package then it will better you give us actual issue or reproduction steps.

Best solution for this is using our Starter-kit where we can test it without any dependency. This will also help you to clear your issue before sending it to us.
