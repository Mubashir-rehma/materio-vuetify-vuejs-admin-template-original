# Data Fetching

We provide custom solution from your data fetching needs. In most of the case, we generally configure the fetching configuration like adding base URL for all of our API calls, setting headers, setting interceptors for Authentication, etc.

## Custom Fetching

### Problem

Assume, we created API endpoint for users and it's available at `/users` endpoint. Then, We had to make API call like this:

```ts
const { data } = await useFetch('https://localhost/api/users')
```

However, we have to repeat `https://localhost/api` for all of our API calls ðŸ˜”

### Solution

With our template, You will get `useApi` & `$api` that is pre-configured with common configuration for data fetching.

`useApi` is configured version of:

- For Vue template => [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/)'s [`useFetch`](https://vueuse.org/core/useFetch/) & [native fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)
- For Nuxt template => [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)'s [`useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch) & their [`$fetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/dollarfetch)

With our custom configuration, You can use `useApi` list a usual `useFetch` composable:

```ts
// No need to repeat `https://localhost/api` now
const { data } = await useApi('/users')
```

## Recommendation

First of all, We recommend you check out [how](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to use [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) to make API calls.

After that,

- For Vue template, Check out the `VueUse` composable documentation and understand the various options it provides.
- For Nuxt template, Checkout their docs on [Data Fetching](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching)  and [useFetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch).

## `useApi` vs `$api`

If you have checked our source code then you might notice that we used `useFetch` & `api`/`$api` together. Nuxt developers already knows the difference between `useApi` *(useFetch under the hood)* & `$fetch`.

:::info Straight from the Nuxt docs
`useFetch` is the most straightforward way to handle data fetching in a component setup function.

On the other hand, when wanting to make a network request based on user interaction, `$fetch` is almost always the right handler to go for.

For Vue, development we recommend checking our Nuxt docs on...
