# Layouts Plugin

We provide framework independent layout system as plugin. You can use it to create your own layouts easily in any vue project with any framework.

## Usage

To use layouts plugin you have to register it like other plugins.

1. Create a new plugin file `@/plugins/layouts.ts` with below content:

    ```ts
    // Layouts plugin
    import { createLayouts } from '@layouts'
    // styles
    import '@layouts/styles/index.scss'
    // get layout config from themeConfig
    import { layoutConfig } from '@themeConfig'

    // ‚ÑπÔ∏è We generate layout config from our themeConfig so you don't have to write config twice
    export default createLayouts(layoutConfig)
    ```

    :::tip
    `themeConfig.ts` file uses `defineThemeConfig` function which return two objects and one of them is configuration of layouts plugin. Hence, you can use this config and omit defining the config twice.
    :::

2. Import and use layouts plugin in `main.ts`

    ```ts
    import layoutsPlugin from '@/plugins/layouts' // [!code ++]
    app.use(layoutsPlugin) // [!code ++]

    ```

That's all. You have successfully configured layouts plugin. ü•≥
