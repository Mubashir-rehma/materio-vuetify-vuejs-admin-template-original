We have developed the AppCardAction component, an extension of the card components. This versatile component is designed to facilitate various actions, such as Initial Loading,refresh, collapsing, and removing cards.

1. Initial Load:
For this action, you need to pass `loading` prop to card and also need to set `isLoading` variable for toggling of loader.

2. Refresh:

3. Collapse:
