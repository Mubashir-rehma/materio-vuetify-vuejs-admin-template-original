# Tour

Tour is helpful way to onboard and guide users through the features of your app.
For this, We have used [vue-shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/vue-shepherd) library in our template.

For more information about vue-shepherd library, please refer to [shepherdjs](https://shepherdjs.dev/docs/) official documentation.

## Styling and theming

To make tour component more attractive, we have override the base style of library in *src/@core/scss/template/libs/shepherd.scss*.

You can override this file to style and theme tour component as per your need.
