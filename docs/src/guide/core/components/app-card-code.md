> File: src/@core/components/cards/AppCardCode.vue

We have developed the AppCardCode component, which extends the card components. This component is utilized to showcase example code snippets.

Below is code snippet of component usage:

::: code-group

```vue [TS]
 <AppCardCode
  title="Basic"
  :code="demoCode.basic"
  >
  <DemoAlertBasic />
</AppCardCode>
```

```vue [JS]
 <AppCardCode
  title="Basic"
  :code="demoCode.basic"
  >
  <DemoAlertBasic />
</AppCardCode>
```
