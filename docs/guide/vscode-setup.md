## Comment Anchors Extension

### Settings

We use [Comment Anchors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExodiusStudios.comment-anchors) extension for quick navigation within a file. We have provided our own extension settings for providing anchors in the file. You can refer to these settings in `.vscode/settings.json` file.

### Snippet

We also provided the snippet for adding the comment anchors. You can find this snippets in `.vscode/comment-anchors.code-snippets` file.

We use "ðŸ‘‰" for adding anchors to the code. You can get this emoji by writing `cm-` (press `ctrl`/`cmd` + `space` if popup doesn't open) and choosing `cm-hand-emoji` snippet.
