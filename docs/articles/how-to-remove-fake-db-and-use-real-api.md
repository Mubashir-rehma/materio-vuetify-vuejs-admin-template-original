# How To Remove Fake Db And Use Real Api

We used [axios-mock-adapter](https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter) for mocking API calls. This makes our template **API ready** üòç and more easier for you to communicate with your backend.

However, you won't need fake-db if you are using real APIs. In this case please follow below steps to remove fake-db from template.

1. Remove `@fake-db` folder from `src` directory
2. Remove fake-db import from `main.js` file

```diff
// File: src/main.js

-  // Axios Mock Adapter
-  import '@/@fake-db/db'
```

3. Finally we don't need axios-mock-adapter in our package any more so remove it from package.json

```diff
{
  dependencies: {
-    "axios-mock-adapter": "^1.19.0",
  }
}
```

This will remove fake-db completely from your package. üéâ

:::warning NOTE
Now all (fake) API calls will result in 404 error until you replace them with your real API endpoints.
