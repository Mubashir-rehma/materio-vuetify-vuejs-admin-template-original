# Welcome

Thanks for purchasing our template üôÇ. Let's get you up and running.

## How to use docs

In this documentation you will find new features, components, composition functions, etc provided by our template other than Vuetify.

::: tip
You can find Vuetify component's docs at their official [documentation](https://vuetifyjs.com/).
:::

Let's install your project first, please visit [installation](/guide/development/installation.md) page for detailed guide on how to install and run materio.

To get started you can check [folder structure](/guide/development/folder-structure.md) of our template to understand how everything is connected.

If you want to quickly update the UI of our template just like you do using customizer, use our themeConfig file for it. You can find documentation for it [here](/guide/development/theme-configuration.md).

Next, certainly you want to create new pages and want to get started with your project, For this you can check our [Layout docs](/guide/layout/layout-types.md) to understand how to use them. Certainly, default layout is zero-config layout but still if you want to understand each layout types, Go for it.

For styling our new materio have managed to provide separate space for your style where you can write your own style and don't accidentally delete ours. Make sure to check out [Template Styles](/guide/development/template-styles.md) for it.

In **Components** section we have provided docs for changes or extra features provided on top of existing Vuetify components.

In **Custom Components** section you will find custom components created by us.

## Starter-kit vs Full Package

### Starter-kit

Starter-kit is minimal template from where you can start your project quickly instead of removing stuff which isn't needed. Below is quick notes on starter-kit:

- No Auth
- No ACL
- No i18n
- Simple Navbar
- Four pages (Two sample pages + 404 + Login)
- No Customizer
- No Axios

Use it if you don't want to clutter your project with extra libs which isn't required.

Don't worry about configuring third party libs which if you want to use them in starter-kit, our template is so flexible that all you have to do is just import lib file in `main.js` file and provided third party package is ready to use üòç.

::: tip
Use starter-kit to provide reproduction steps if you raise any technical [issue on GitHub](/guide/getting-started/support.md).
:::

### Full Package

This setup have all the things which you can see in live demo. Except that red Buy Now button üòÖ.

With this you have to remove things which you don't use or replace them with your content.

**Conclusion**

According to us, starter-kit is easy to get started with minimal setup and our folder and code structure will help you adding libs support in starter-kit **more easily than ever**. Still if your project becomes easy with full package go for it.
