# Folder Structure

## @core

This directory contains our core files and your are intended to change these files.

## @fake-db

It contains fake data we get back from API. This is only useful if you want to check what API call returns in response.

## assets

It contains logos and other static assets. You can place your static assets here.

## components

Place your component in this directory. Components in this dir will be auto-registered and on-demand, thanks to [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components).

:::details How it will auto register components on demand ðŸ¤¯

1. Just create new component in `components` directory
2. Reference it in Pascal case name in any file

**Example:**

It will automatically turn this

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <HelloWorld msg="Hello Vue 3.0 + Vite" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "App",
  };
</script>
```

into this

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <HelloWorld msg="Hello Vue 3.0 + Vite" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import HelloWorld from "./src/components/HelloWorld.vue";

  export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
      HelloWorld,
    },
  };
</script>
```

## layouts

Place your app's layouts in this directory. This is used in conjunction with [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) which is used for `pages` directory to generate routes based on directory structure just like [nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/).

## navigation

This directory contains vertical nav & horizontal nav items. Items written in `/src/navigation/vertical/index.{ts|js}` will be for vertical nav and items written in `/src/navigation/horizontal/index.{ts|js}` will be for horizontal nav. Both files are imported in `/src/layouts/default.vue`).

## pages

Contains your app pages. Just create a new file and new route will be auto generated based on file name and its placement in the `pages` directory.

:::details Show me basic example ðŸ‘€

1. Create a new file in pages directory `/src/pages/about.vue` with following content
   ```html
   <template>
     <p>This is about page</p>
   </template>
   ```
2. Visit [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about)

âœ¨ Route is auto generated based on your file name
