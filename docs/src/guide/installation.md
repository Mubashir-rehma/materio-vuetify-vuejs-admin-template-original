# Installation

## Prerequisite

- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager is recommended
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version is required

:::details How do I check my node version?
Run below command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

Make sure output version is LTS version.
:::

## Getting started

1. Download our template from marketplace
2. Unzip it in your desired location

    :::danger Getting Error: [plugin:vite:css] [sass] Can't find stylesheet to import.

    You might get this error on Windows OS if you unzip the template in a directory which has **space in its path**. For example, `C:\Users\My User\Documents\my-project`. Notice, there is a space in `My User` directory name.

    To avoid this error, please make sure you unzip the template in a directory which doesn't have space in its path. For example, `C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\my-project`. Additionally, also make sure your project it self doesn't have space in its name. For example, `my-project` is fine but `my project` is not.

    We already reported the issue to vuetify team. You can track the issue here: [#300](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify-loader/issues/300)
    :::

3. Navigate to the project you want to run (`full-version` or `starter-kit`). To make sure you are in right directory check if that directory contains files like `package.json`, `.gitignore` etc.

:::details Copying from unzipped directory
If you are copying file from unzipped directory then make sure to copy all the hidden files as well, like `.eslintrc.js`, `.gitignore`, etc.

To make sure, match the zip file content and extracted directory.

Enable show hidden files feature in your system to view the hidden files if you can't see them in extracted directory.
:::

4. Open terminal in that directory
5. Run below commands:

```bash
# It will install all packages
pnpm install

# Will start the dev server
pnpm run dev
```

6. Open the dev server URL in browser.

## Generating build for production

1. To generate a production build, use the following commands:

::: code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm build
```

```bash [npm]
npm run build
```

:::

2. Previewing build differs for both Vue and Nuxt. Please follow the guide for your framework:

### Vue

Once the build is generated, you can preview it on your local system using the following commands:

::: code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm preview
```

```bash [npm]
npm run preview
```

:::tip
Refer to [this](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) documentation for detailed deployment guide.
:::

### Nuxt

You can preview normal nuxt app via below command:

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

Above command will work for our starter-kit as well.

However, we have in full version of the template we have need to set some environment variables before running above command. So, for full version of the template, run below command:

```bash
# ‚ùó Assuming preview will be on localhost:3000
AUTH_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET AUTH_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 node .output/server/index.mjs
```

:::details What is `AUTH_SECRET`?
`AUTH_SECRET` is just random but confidential
:::

If you have more environment variables, You can add them like `AUTH_ORIGIN` and `AUTH_SECRET`.

:::warning Note
Make sure you are in the project directory before running above commands and also that you have pnpm or npm installed on your machine
