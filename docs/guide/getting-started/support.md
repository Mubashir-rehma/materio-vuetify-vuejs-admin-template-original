## Raising Support Ticket

Raising support ticket in support portal is as simple as commenting on post. However, If you want get your issues resolved quickly please follow below guide:

### Finding existing solution

There might be case that you issue is already resolved and you are the one who is facing due to some issue. So before creating new support ticket please search it in our [FAQ page](/faq/) where we listed most common questions/issues asked in our support portal.

### Ticket Type

Add ticket type to your ticket title to let community understand what your ticket is about. This also helps to find related tickets using ticket type.

So, your ticket till will be like `[question] how to change theme?`

Some common ticket types are listed below:

- **question** - If you are asking question
- **installation** - If you have anything related to installation
- **auth** - If you have anything related to JWT or Auth
- **acl** - If you have anything related to Access Control
- **feat-req** - If you have any feature request for our template
- **bug** - If you find any bug in template
- **other** - if your ticket doesn't related to above mentioned ticket types

Good examples can be: üíØ

- [question] How to change theme?
- [question] How to change i18n locale?
- [installation] Getting errors in npm run serve
- [auth] Unexpected behavior after login
- [other] Collapse component is not working as expected
- [acl] How to disable certain routes for some user
- [auth] I get redirected to login page even after login on refresh

### New Issue - New ticket

Following above suggestion, it will be good if you create another support ticket if you have any other question/issue which is not related to your current ticket.

Let's say you opened ticket for installation issue and want to ask about some component usage then it will be better to close installation ticket and open another ticket for that component to make support portal more accurate and easy find place.
